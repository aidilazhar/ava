When you visit the Site, some information is automatically collected. For example, we collect information on the pages you have visited and the contents of those pages, any information you input, your referring URL or IP address, the time of your visit and related session information, your requested page, browser type, USR agent, status of request (successful reply), cookies, number of bytes in the response, and query string.

Cookies
The Site uses cookies, which are small text files placed on your computer by a website. Cookies enable AVAVA to track usage patterns and deliver customized content to users. These cookies cannot read information from your hard drive. AVAVA uses cookies to collect and store your User ID, which is not personally identifiable to you. The information is only used to identify repeat visitors to the Site. The Site also uses temporary session cookies to assign and store a Session ID to you so that you can move uninterrupted between areas of our Web Site. AVAVA also uses the Session ID for internal reporting purposes. This Session ID is not personally identifiable to you and this type of cookie does not leave any retrievable information on your hard drive. The User ID does not have an expiration date. Session IDs expire when the browser is closed.
</p><p>
The Site may also use 3rd party vendor re-marketing tracking cookies, including the Google Adwords tracking cookie. This allows AVAVA to make special offers and continue to market our products across the Internet to those who have shown interest on the Site. As always, we respect your privacy and are not collecting any identifiable information through the use of Google’s or any other third party remarketing system.

We recommend that you leave the cookies activated in order to access optimal features on the Site.
</p><p>
Certain features on the Site may be provided by third party services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing that feature, not this privacy policy.
</p><p>
Information Collected by our Applications
When you register to use the Applications, AVAVA collects your email address and we may ask you to provide us additional information.  We use this information to create a registration profile and to validate your registration when you log in to the Applications. In some cases, our customers have implemented a Single Sign On registration process where the login credentials you use with the customer’s service are shared with AVAVA. Once you have registered, you may also voluntarily provide additional information to the Applications, such as your name, updated address information, and other profile information.

 </p><p>
The Applications are often embedded in our customers’ websites or in other third party sites, and may be controlled by our customers or other third parties.  Our Applications may also contain links to third party sites that are not owned or controlled by AVAVA.  Those websites and third party sites may have other terms and privacy policies that govern their use that are different from these terms.  Please be aware that AVAVA is not responsible for the privacy practices of third party sites. AVAVA encourages you to be aware of who controls the sites that you visit and to read the privacy statements of all sites that collect personally identifiable information.
</p><p>
By registering to use the Applications, you agree to allow us to provide your email address to our customer who has established the website that includes the Applications.  In some cases, you may have shared your email address with that customer already, such as by registering for a service offered by that customer.  That customer’s use of your email address is subject to its privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy.
